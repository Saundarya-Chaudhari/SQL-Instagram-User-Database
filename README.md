# SQL Instagram User Database Project

## Introduction
This project is based on a SQL database that simulates an Instagram platform, consisting of seven tables: `users`, `tags`, `photos`, `photo_tags`, `likes`, `follows`, and `comments`. It performs various SQL queries to extract insights and information about the users and their activities on the platform.

## Tasks Performed

### Find the 5 Oldest Users on Instagram
Using the `users` table, the project identifies the five oldest users on Instagram based on their date of birth. This query allows us to understand the platform's longevity and user demographics.

### Users with Zero Photo Posts
The SQL query filters users who have never posted any photos on Instagram. This information provides insights into user engagement and activity levels on the platform.

### Contest Winner Identification
The project determines the winner of a contest by analyzing data related to likes, follows, and comments on photos. The SQL query identifies the user with the highest engagement during the contest period and provides their details to the team.

### Top 5 Most Commonly Used Hashtags
Using the `tags` and `photo_tags` tables, the project analyzes the usage of hashtags on the platform. It identifies and suggests the top five most commonly used hashtags, which can help users understand current trends and interests.

### Most Popular Registration Day
The project identifies the day of the week when most users register on the platform. This information helps in scheduling ad campaigns and targeting user acquisition strategies.

### Average User Post Frequency
The SQL query calculates the average number of posts made by each user on Instagram. Additionally, it provides the total number of photos and users on the platform, giving an overview of user-generated content.

### Identification of Bot Users
By analyzing the data from the `likes` table, the project identifies users who have liked every single photo on the platform. These users are potentially bots, as this activity is unlikely for genuine users.

## Conclusion
This SQL Instagram User Database Project demonstrates the capabilities of SQL for data analysis on a simulated Instagram platform. The various queries provide valuable insights into user behavior, engagement, and platform trends. The project fosters a better understanding of user data analytics and can be expanded to include more complex analyses and visualizations for further exploration.
